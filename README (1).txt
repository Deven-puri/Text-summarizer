Hello , I am Deven 
In this project I have made a text summarizer using 
1. nltk(natural language toolkit)
2. scikit-learn : which is necessary to find TF-IDF(Time frequency inverse document frequency) score of all the unique keywords(expect stopwords)
3. transformers : I have used a hugging face transformer , I have used pegasys library which is model specially fine tuned for summarization.
4. Flask : it is a web framework which is used to create web application interface 
5. socket : this library is used to find the free ports and hosts on internet
I have used basic html took some refrence from online regarding TD-IDF scores since it was my first time working with TF-IDF scores 
if you are using a linux then make sure that the python is installed in you desktop and usingbthe following command you can access the host 
python file_name.py
